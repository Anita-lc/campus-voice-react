# Admin Routing Update

## Changes Made

Updated the application routing to separate admin and user experiences completely.

## New Behavior

### **For Admin Users:**
- ✅ Login redirects to `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
- ✅ Cannot access user pages (`/dashboard`, `/submit-feedback`, `/my-feedback`, `/feedback/:id`)
- ✅ Attempting to access user pages redirects to `/admin`
- ✅ See only Admin Dashboard with all feedback management features

### **For Regular Users:**
- ✅ Login redirects to `/dashboard` (User Dashboard)
- ✅ Cannot access `/admin` page
- ✅ Attempting to access admin page redirects to `/dashboard`
- ✅ See only their own feedback and submission features

## Files Modified

### 1. **src/App.tsx**
- Added `userOnly` prop to `ProtectedRoute` component
- Updated `PublicRoute` to redirect based on user role
- Protected user routes with `userOnly` flag:
  - `/dashboard`
  - `/submit-feedback`
  - `/my-feedback`
  - `/feedback/:id`
- Admin route remains protected with `adminOnly` flag

### 2. **src/components/Navbar.tsx**
- Removed "Admin Panel" dropdown link
- Cleaner navigation for both user types

### 3. **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx**
- Removed "Admin Panel" sidebar link
- Admins won't see this page anyway

## Login Credentials

### Admin Access:
```
Email: admin@campusvoice.edu
Password: admin123
→ Redirects to: /admin
```

### Student Access:
```
Email: student@campusvoice.edu
Password: student123
→ Redirects to: /dashboard
```

## Route Protection Logic

```typescript
// Admin-only routes
if (adminOnly && user.role !== 'ADMIN') {
  return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />;
}

// User-only routes (blocks admins)
if (userOnly && user.role === 'ADMIN') {
  return <Navigate to="/admin" replace />;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Admins and users have completely separate interfaces
2. **Better UX**: No confusion about which dashboard to use
3. **Security**: Role-based access control enforced at routing level
4. **Simplified Navigation**: Removed unnecessary links for each role

## Testing

1. **Test Admin Flow:**
   - Login as admin → Should land on `/admin`
   - Try to visit `/dashboard` → Should redirect to `/admin`

2. **Test User Flow:**
   - Login as student → Should land on `/dashboard`
   - Try to visit `/admin` → Should redirect to `/dashboard`

3. **Test Direct URL Access:**
   - Both roles should be properly redirected based on permissions
